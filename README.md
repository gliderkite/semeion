# semeion

An experimental 2D environment simulator, that let's you define the behavior and
the shape of your entities, while taking care of dispatching events generation
after generation.


## Examples

 - [Langton's Ant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant)
    
    ```bash
    cargo run --release --example langton
    ```


## Semantic Versioning

This library is extremely experimental, but it follows the basic rules of
[semantic versioning](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-version-field).
